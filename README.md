## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Animations
- Mobile Responsiveness

### What I learned

Learned more about flexboxes, using flex grow to push the footer down onto the bottom of the screen. learned about animations, keyframes, and the like. and learned about responsiveness by using media queries. Learned more about keeping the HTML as semantic as i can. reducing the usage of divs and spans.


### Continued development

I am already satisfied with the challenge. i dont see anymore things to work on.
